          <h2>Hello Educators!</h2>
        
          <p>We are happy that you decided to try JBF in your class. </p>
          
          <p>
            Our goal is to improve student learning with our simulation of protein separation and analysis tools. 
            The simulation is easy to use, free and fun and will help prepare students for lab experiments.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When we started to test JBF with students to assess  their learning outcomes, we entered an iterative process of 
              revising the problem sets that we have created to go along with JBF. We have also incorporated Bloom's taxonomy 
              to clarify the learning goals for each aspect of JBF [<a href = "http://www.lifescied.org/content/7/4/368.full" target = "_new">Biology in Bloom: Implementing 
            Bloom's Taxonomy to Enhance Student Learning in Biology by Alison Crow, Clarissa Dirks and Mary Pat Wenderoth</a>]. 
          </p>
          
          <p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your interest by providing all the materials that you 
            need to get started right away:</p>

            As we are still learning how to make JBF better by using student surveys after each trial, please don't hesitate to
